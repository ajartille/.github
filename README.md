This isn't even a user profile; it's an "organization." Someone was actually kind enough to gift the name [@AJAr](https://github.com/ajar) for ~~my own vanity~~ public benefit and the greater good. Thank you for this, kind stranger. I can't drive the point home any further: Please see [@AJAr](https://github.com/ajar).
